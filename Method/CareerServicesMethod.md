### BYU-Idaho Career Services - "The Method"

BYU-Idaho Career Services developed a method of helping students land a job, which they call "The Method".

The Method consists of four activities: Exploring, Informational Interviews, Proximity, and Evaluation.

- **Exploring Explorers and Connect:** A set of activities that help students create employer lists and work with alumni on BYU-I Connect and LinkedIn.

- **Proximity to Employers:** Helps students learn how to set up and work with LinkedIn, manage network contacts, find jobs, work with societies, and set up portfolio tools.
