# Building Your Network

I've read several books on networking and have been actively working on it for the past couple of years. However, I still feel like I've only scratched the surface of the possibilities. It's true that the more you learn, the more you realize how much you didn't knowâ€”this applies to most things in life.

Here are some networking suggestions:

1. **Connect with Friends and Family:**
   - Your strongest connections often come from family and friends. They likely know someone in the tech field within their ward, stake, or neighborhood. These connections might be the Ward Clerk, Tech Specialist, or neighborhood IT support person. ("So and So just fixed grandma's computer.")
   
2. **Connect with Classmates and Roommates:**
   - Consider your college classmates and roommates. You might be surprised by where they are now. Networking is about getting to know the people in their networks. ("Dude, my friend back home set up a game system on a server, and we played with people from all over the world.")
   
3. **Connect with Alumni:**
   - Alumni can be powerful allies in learning about companies. They still have a positive impression of the school. Studies show that 95% of them remain active in the church and are familiar with the area. They're also connected through their wards and stakes. ("Who do you know that works in the area?")
   
4. **Super-Connectors:**
   - Explore the BYUI Connect platform (found on the Career Center website). Super-connectors are alumni with over 500 connections. Why are they important?
     - They have a vast network.
     - They're open to helping you connect with more people.
     - Once connected, you gain access to their connections.
   
5. **Expand Your Network:**
   - After connecting with people, start growing your network by asking for referrals.
