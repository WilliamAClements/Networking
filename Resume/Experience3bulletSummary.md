This is an easy way to think about what to put for each job experience.

### Experience: 3-Bullet Summary

Each bullet should be one or two sentences in length. The bullets can be combined to save space. In parenthesis, you should mention programming principles, languages, and tools.

- **Job Description:** Brief job description with technology that you learned
  - From the title, knowing what you actually did is sometimes difficult.
- **2nd Line: Results** What did you contribute to the job, and the results (metrics)
  - Every piece of advice I have received when writing a resume is to show through metrics how I helped the company by being results-oriented.
- **3rd Line: Learned** What did you enjoy/learn from your job?
  - Lastly, employment is a two-way street; you are providing a service for which you get paid, and your loyalty to the company typically comes in the form of what they can do for you or what you have learned, grown, or enjoyed about the job's domain knowledge. What made this job bigger or better than the last job?

### What Else Do You Want to Know:
- How do I start collecting metrics on my job?
- What do you mean by finding a job that is bigger or better?
