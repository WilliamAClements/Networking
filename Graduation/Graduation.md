# BYU-Idaho Degree Information

The goal of going to school is to graduate with a degree. As you are aware, there are several types of degrees, from one-year certificates to two-year Associate, and four-year Bachelor that are offered at BYU-Idaho.

The university is split up into different colleges. Each college has a set of departments. Each department’s responsibilities include maintaining the different degrees. Our college is the Physical Science and Engineering, and under that is the Computer Science and Engineering department. 

## Degree Fields of Study

We have several different degree fields of study:

- Computer Science 
- Electrical Engineering 
- Computer Engineering
- Cloud Computing
- Software Engineering
- Cyber Security

## Degree Requirements

Once you have reached the requirements for each of these, you can graduate. The credit requirements are as follows:

- Certificate: around 30 credits
- Associate: 60 credits
- Bachelor: 120 credits

## Graduation Process

When it comes to graduation or the last semester of your academic career, you need to apply for graduation. The deadline is usually around the middle of the semester. You should apply earlier, just to make sure that you have fulfilled all of the requirements. 

Graduation itself is just a ceremony. There are two parts to it, along with additional activities, such as the department graduation social. Expect at least three activities that you can share with your friends and family:

1. **Convocation:** The president of the school officially announces that you will be graduating. This is where you line up in the iCenter and walk based on the colleges.
2. **Commencement:** They hand out the folder where you will eventually store your diploma. They don’t give you your actual diploma until 3-4 weeks after everything has been checked and verified, as grades aren’t due until a week after the last day of the semester.
