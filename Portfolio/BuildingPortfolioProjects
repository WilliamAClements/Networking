# Building a Portfolio of Projects

Projects play a crucial role in setting you apart from other students. They demonstrate your motivation, passion for your career, creativity, problem-solving abilities, and practical application of new skills.

Having interviewed over 100 companies in the last seven years, I can confidently say that two factors make a candidate stand out: projects and soft skills. Soft skills encompass teamwork, effective communication, problem-solving, and ensuring customer satisfaction (which we'll delve into another time). Let's focus on projects.

## Starting Your Portfolio

Begin by leveraging your class assignments and capstone project. These assignments typically require you to meet the minimum requirements for an A grade (around 93%). To reach 100%, consider extending the assignment creatively or by implementing additional stretch requirements. After completing the assignment, take the opportunity to reflect on what you've learned.

## Steps to Showcase Your Work

1. **Portfolium Entry:**
   - Use the Career Center's Portfolium software.
   - Include a screenshot of your software in action.
   - Title: Specify the project name.
   - Description:
     - Explain the project, including the programming principles, languages, and tools used.
     - Provide a reference to the assignment (either from iLearn or a link to the assignment's GitPages).
     - Add a link to your GitHub repository where you store the assignment.
     - Describe any extensions you've made to the original assignment.

2. **LinkedIn Post:**
   - Create a LinkedIn post similar to your Portfolium entry.
   - Instead of referencing GitHub, link to your Portfolium post.
   - Mention the key lessons you learned from the assignment.

## Audience Matters

Why go through this process? Each layer serves a different audience:
- **LinkedIn:** Tailored for HR professionals.
- **Portfolium:** Attracts project managers.
- **GitHub:** Appeals to fellow software engineers.

As you complete your classes, your portfolio grows, and so does your network.
